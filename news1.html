        <p>Among the latest technological breakthroughs, a portable low-radiation X-ray machine using advanced carbon nanotube technology won the North American Radiology Society Award for Best Innovative Technology. The breakthrough development of this technology has attracted a lot of attention from the global medical community.</p>
        <p>Energy nanotube technology is an emerging technology with great potential in the field of X-ray imaging, which combines the advantages of energy materials and nanotube technology. This technology provides excellent image quality while significantly reducing radiation dose, providing better protection for patient health and the safety of medical personnel.</p>
        <p>The advantage of this portable low-emissivity X-ray machine is its lightweight design and excellent imaging capabilities. Thanks to the carbon nanotube technology, the size and weight of the device have been greatly reduced, making it easy to carry and use, whether in hospitals or outdoor clinics.</p>
        <p><img src="img/news1-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>a portable low-radiation X-ray machine</p>
        <p>The Radiological Society of North America, as the authority on evaluating radiology and imaging techniques, highly values the potential of this innovative technology. They recognized the uniqueness of carbon nanotube technology and its important contribution to the field of radiology, and awarded the device the best innovative technology award. This honor not only affirms the revolutionary nature of this technology, but also has great significance for further promoting the development of medical imaging technology.</p>
        <p>Encouraged by this accolade, the company has confirmed that it will present this innovative technology at the future Dental Exhibition in Cologne, Germany. The show is an important event in the international medical technology sector, attracting professionals and industry leaders from all over the world. By participating in this exhibition, the company hopes to further promote the technology and open up the international market.</p>
        <p>The advent of this portable low-emissivity X-ray machine has aroused the interest of dentists and other medical professionals because it provides a safer and more effective tool for dental diagnosis and treatment. The application of carbon nanotube technology provides clearer and more detailed images for tooth imaging, while greatly reducing the risk of radiation exposure.</p>
        <p>The award and participation of this innovative technology will promote the application of carbon nanotube technology in the field of medical imaging, bringing more benefits and safety to patients and medical professionals. With the continuous development of technology, we can expect this technology to play a greater role in the field of medical imaging in the future, bringing more innovations and breakthroughs to the medical industry.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>Energy Resources International Co, Ltd. recently announced the launch of a revolutionary lightweight portable X-ray machine, 
                 which will bring a huge breakthrough to the medical industry. Traditional removable X-ray machines weigh between 300 and 600 kilograms, 
                 making them difficult to move. However, 
                 in the context of the outbreak of the epidemic and the vigorous development of telemedicine, 
                 the successful development of a lightweight portable X-ray machine weighing only 3.2 kg will greatly change the way medical treatment is made.</p>
